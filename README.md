# Spaceinvaders-clone
An very simple space invaders clone I did while learning SDL1.2(by reading, and looking at the documentation found on https://github.com/lispbuilder/lispbuilder), and the first "proper" video game I made(that's not pong).


Utilises the firacode font - https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/


# How to run (from code):
Get the SDL1.2 library files (.dll for windows, .so for linux), may have to compile form [source](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL-1.2)

Get [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)
